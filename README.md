# Project Title
MyToken - A simple ERC20 token smart contract

# Description
MyToken is an ERC20 token smart contract written in Solidity. It has public variables that store the details about the token, including the token name, abbreviation, and total supply. The contract also has a mapping of addresses to balances and two functions: mint and burn. The mint function increases the total supply by a specified amount and increases the balance of a given address by that amount, while the burn function decreases the total supply and the balance of a given address by a specified amount.

# Getting Started
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow the steps below to get started:<br/>
• Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.<br/>
• Create a new file(.sol extension) and paste the code from the MyTokeProject\myToken.sol file.<br/>
• Compile the contract by clicking the Solidity Compiler tab and selecting the appropriate compiler version (0.8.18 in this case).<br/>
• Deploy the contract by clicking the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.<br/>
• Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn functions and passing in the appropriate parameters.
